 /**
  * ! In this program  we will create a java program to find all armstrong numbers between two intervals. 
  * ! For this purpose we will ask the user to enter starting range and ending range so that all armstrong 
  * ! numbers between this range can be find and an armstrong number of three digits is the number whose sum 
  * ! of the cubes of its digits is equal to the given number or can say the number itself should be the result.

  * ! Let us consider an example for understanding armstrong number in a better way.

  * @ Example :

   * % Suppose a number is 407 ;
   * % Cubes of its digits are :
   * %    Cube of 4 = 64 ;

   * %    Cube of 0 = 0 ;

   * %    Cube of 7 =  343 ;

 * $ Sum of all digitâ€™s cube : 64 + 0 + 343 =407
 * $ Here the calculated result is equal to the given number ;

 * $ So, 407 is an Armstrong Number.
